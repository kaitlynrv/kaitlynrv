## Hey, I'm Kaitlyn 👋

I'm a data scientist focused on understanding how people interact with AI systems. 

**What I work on:**
- Experimentation and causal inference for product decisions
- ML for personalization and prediction (LightGBM, neural networks, feature engineering)
- LLM-powered analytics tools and agentic systems
- Self-serve analytics infrastructure

**Background:** Math & Quantitative Economics (Tufts) → Business Analytics (Wake Forest) → 
Data Science in the wild

**Currently exploring:** How developers adopt and use AI coding tools, measurement 
frameworks for AI products, and building reliable systems at the intersection of 
ML capabilities and human behavior.

Always curious about where AI succeeds, where it fails, and how data can help us 
understand the difference.
